Start room generates at 0x0
using "algorithm" generate 2-4 connecting rooms of specific type

*Ignoring secret rooms for now*
algo
 - depending on room type, determine if rooms need to be generated 
 Rules:
 - Starting room: 
    - always generates 2-4 connecting rooms, min 1 regular or trap room
 - Regular room: 
    - Frequently generates 1 connecting room, can be "leaf room" 
    - Prefers generating more connections closer to the start
 - Trap room: same as regular room
 - Shop, treasure, other special rooms: 
    - Generates no connections, "leaf room"
    - Must spawn 1 per floor
 - Boss: 
    - requires an ammount of distance from the starting room, always a "leaf room"
    - Must spawn 1 per floor
Determining where to spawn rooms:
 - After the first spawn(from start room):
    - Directions towards spawn would be given negative weight
    - Directions that would end up connected to another room will be given negative weight
    - All other directions will be given positive weight
      - e.g: 0x0-->0x1-->0x2, 0x2 would be positive
      - BUT 0x0-->0x1-->1x1 would be given negative weight if a room is at 1x0
